# Template for Clean Architecture with React

Hi, folks! How is it going? 😉

I decide to learn about clean architecture and good practices using ReactJS.
So, I'm gonna use this repo to for it 😁.

## How to run

Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Run this followed commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
yarn install

# Run the local server at localhost:3000
yarn start
```

**Enjoy!! 😊**
